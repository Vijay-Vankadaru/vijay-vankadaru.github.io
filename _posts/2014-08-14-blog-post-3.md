## A New Chapter in Research

By early 2024, our team at DASION had achieved significant milestones in medical imaging analysis, but we were ready for new challenges. The success of our computer vision models opened doors to explore more complex multimodal AI systems, particularly in voice analysis and depression detection.

## Starting UC Berkeley MIDS

In August 2024, I began my Master's in Information and Data Science at UC Berkeley while continuing to work full-time at DASION. The MIDS program provided the perfect complement to my practical experience, offering advanced coursework in machine learning, data science, and research methodologies. Balancing graduate studies with leading research projects at DASION has been challenging but incredibly rewarding.

## The Work-School Balance

Managing full-time work at DASION while pursuing my master's degree at Berkeley requires careful planning and time management. The practical experience I bring from DASION enriches classroom discussions, while the theoretical foundations from MIDS inform my research approach. It's a unique opportunity to bridge industry practice with academic rigor.

## The Voice Analysis Challenge

Our new focus on voice-based depression detection represented a significant technical leap. Unlike static medical images, voice data is temporal, complex, and highly variable. We needed to develop entirely new approaches to feature extraction, dealing with everything from background noise to emotional state variations.

## Multimodal Integration

One of our most exciting new projects involved combining voice analysis with our existing computer vision capabilities. The idea was to create a comprehensive assessment system that could analyze both how someone looks and how they sound - a true multimodal approach to clinical assessment.

## Technical Challenges

The new projects brought fresh technical challenges:
- **Real-time Processing**: Voice analysis needed to work in real-time, unlike our batch processing for medical images
- **Data Quality**: Voice data is much noisier than medical images, requiring robust preprocessing
- **Interpretability**: Clinical applications demand explainable AI, so we needed to develop new visualization techniques
- **Scalability**: Our systems needed to handle multiple patients simultaneously

## Collaboration with Academia

These new projects also marked the beginning of our collaboration with Professor Weiqing Gu from Harvey Mudd College. Having an academic partner brought new rigor to our research methodology and opened doors to NSF funding opportunities.

## Learning and Growing

Each new project taught us something different. Voice analysis required deep understanding of signal processing. Multimodal fusion demanded expertise in attention mechanisms and cross-modal learning. The challenges were steep, but the learning curve was exhilarating.

## Looking Ahead

As we dive deeper into these new research areas, I'm excited about the potential impact. The combination of voice analysis and computer vision could revolutionize how we approach mental health assessment, making it more objective, accessible, and accurate.
