## A New Academic Chapter

In August 2024, I began my Master's in Information and Data Science at UC Berkeley while continuing to work full-time at DASION. This marked a significant transition in my academic journey - from completing my bachelor's degree while working in industry to pursuing graduate studies with clear aspirations for PhD applications.

## The Decision to Pursue Graduate Studies

After graduating from UC Riverside with my computer science degree, I made the conscious decision to pursue graduate studies at Berkeley. My goal was clear: to work with faculty, gain academic research experience, and prepare for PhD applications. The MIDS program seemed like the perfect bridge between my industry experience and academic aspirations.

## Balancing Work and Graduate Studies

Managing full-time work at DASION while pursuing my master's degree at Berkeley requires careful planning and time management. The practical experience I bring from DASION enriches classroom discussions, while the theoretical foundations from MIDS inform my research approach. It's a unique opportunity to bridge industry practice with academic rigor.

## Learning Academic Research Methods

The MIDS program has introduced me to academic research methodologies that differ significantly from the private research I've conducted at DASION. I'm learning about:
- **Literature review**: How to systematically analyze existing research
- **Research design**: Creating rigorous experimental frameworks
- **Academic writing**: Communicating research findings for the scientific community
- **Statistical analysis**: Proper methods for validating research results

## Building Academic Connections

One of my primary goals in the MIDS program is to build relationships with faculty members who can guide my research and potentially collaborate on projects. I'm actively seeking opportunities to work with professors whose research aligns with my interests in multimodal AI and healthcare applications.

## Preparing for PhD Applications

The MIDS program is providing the academic foundation I need for competitive PhD applications. I'm learning about:
- **Research methodologies**: How to design and conduct rigorous studies
- **Academic standards**: Expectations for reproducibility and open science
- **Publication process**: Understanding how academic research is shared and validated
- **Faculty collaboration**: Building relationships with potential PhD advisors

## The Work-School Balance

Balancing full-time work at DASION, graduate studies at Berkeley, and preparing for PhD applications has been challenging but incredibly rewarding. The ability to apply theoretical concepts from MIDS coursework directly to my work at DASION has accelerated both my academic learning and our research progress.

## Looking Forward

As I progress through the MIDS program, I'm excited about the opportunities to work with faculty and begin my transition from industry research to academic scholarship. The foundation I'm building now will be crucial for my PhD applications and future academic career.

*Follow along as I continue this journey toward academic research and PhD studies. The best chapters are yet to come.*
