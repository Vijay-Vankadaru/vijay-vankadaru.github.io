## Starting as a High School Intern

In September 2021, I walked into DASION as a high school intern, eager to learn about machine learning but with no idea how transformative this experience would be. At 17, I was fascinated by the potential of AI in healthcare but had only theoretical knowledge from online courses and personal projects.

## The Learning Curve

Those first few months were intense. I was thrown into real healthcare data, learning about HIPAA compliance, clinical workflows, and the complexities of building AI systems that could actually impact patient care. The team was patient with my questions about everything from database optimization to neural network architectures.

## First Real Impact

By early 2022, I had moved from simple data cleaning tasks to contributing to our first computer vision model for medical imaging. Seeing that first 93% diagnostic accuracy result was exhilarating - I was part of something that could genuinely help doctors make better decisions.

## The Evolution

What started as a summer internship evolved into a full-time role as I graduated high school and began my computer science studies at UC Riverside. The combination of academic learning and real-world application accelerated my growth in ways I never expected.

## Balancing Work and School

One of the biggest challenges was learning to balance full-time work at DASION with my computer science studies at UC Riverside. Working 40+ hours per week while maintaining a strong academic record required careful time management and prioritization. The practical experience I gained at DASION often complemented my coursework, giving me a unique perspective on how theoretical concepts applied in real-world scenarios.

## Looking Forward

Now, as I prepare for PhD applications and continue leading research projects, I'm grateful for that high school intern who was willing to ask questions and learn. The journey from intern to research lead has taught me that the best learning happens when you're solving real problems that matter.
