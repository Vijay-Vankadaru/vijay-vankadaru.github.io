## The Challenge of Teaching Complex Concepts

By 2023, I had evolved from that eager high school intern to leading a team of new interns at DASION. One of my most rewarding responsibilities became teaching computer vision and CNNs to our incoming team members. It's one thing to understand these concepts yourself - it's entirely another to explain them clearly to others.

## Starting with the Basics

I quickly learned that effective teaching requires breaking down complex concepts into digestible pieces. We started with the fundamentals: what are pixels, how do images become numbers, and why do we need convolutional layers? The "aha!" moments when interns finally grasped how filters work were incredibly satisfying.

## Hands-On Learning

Theoretical knowledge only goes so far. I designed hands-on exercises where interns could build simple CNNs from scratch, visualize feature maps, and see how different architectures perform on real medical imaging data. There's something powerful about watching someone build their first working model.

## Real-World Applications

What made our teaching sessions unique was the immediate application to real healthcare problems. Instead of working with generic datasets, interns were learning CNNs while contributing to our medical imaging analysis projects. The connection between theory and practice was always clear.

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

Through teaching, I identified common misconceptions that trip up newcomers:
- **Overfitting**: Many interns would create models that performed perfectly on training data but failed on validation sets
- **Data Preprocessing**: Understanding why medical images need different preprocessing than natural images
- **Architecture Choices**: When to use deeper networks vs. when simpler models suffice

## The Mentor's Perspective

Teaching CNNs to interns taught me as much as it taught them. Explaining concepts forced me to understand them more deeply, and seeing problems through fresh eyes often led to new insights. The best learning happens when you're teaching others.

## Building the Next Generation

Now, as I prepare for PhD studies, I'm proud to have helped train the next generation of ML engineers. Several of our former interns have gone on to pursue their own research interests, and I like to think our teaching sessions played a small role in their journeys.

## The UC Riverside Graduation

By 2023, I was approaching graduation from UC Riverside while continuing to work full-time at DASION. The experience of completing my computer science degree while leading research projects gave me a unique perspective on the intersection of academic theory and practical application. Graduating with hands-on experience in production ML systems was invaluable preparation for the next phase of my journey.
