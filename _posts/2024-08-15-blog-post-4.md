## The Decision to Pursue Academic Research

After years of conducting private research at DASION while completing my bachelor's degree at UC Riverside, I made the decision to transition toward academic research. In August 2024, I enrolled in the UC Berkeley MIDS program with clear aspirations: to work with faculty, gain academic research experience, and prepare for PhD applications.

## From Private Research to Academic Publication

My background at DASION was entirely focused on private, industry research. While I gained extensive experience in healthcare AI, voice analysis, and multimodal systems, everything was proprietary and internal. The transition to academic research represents a completely new challenge - learning how to conduct research that can be shared with the broader scientific community.

## Starting My First Academic Research Projects

In May and June 2025, I began working on my first academic research projects:

### "Neural Audio Sentiment Analysis for Clinical Depression Detection" (Started May 2025)
This project builds on my experience with voice analysis at DASION, but now focuses on developing interpretable AI systems suitable for academic publication and clinical deployment.

### "Ultra-Fast Reasoning Models for Audio Content Intelligence" (Started June 2025)
This work explores efficient neural architectures for real-time audio processing, addressing computational challenges I've encountered in industry applications.

## Learning the Academic Research Process

The transition from industry to academic research has been eye-opening. I'm learning about:
- **Research methodology**: How to design rigorous studies and experiments
- **Literature review**: Understanding existing work and positioning my contributions
- **Academic writing**: Communicating research findings in a way that serves the scientific community
- **Publication venues**: Learning about different conferences and journals, their focus areas, and submission processes

## The Challenge of Academic Publishing

Coming from a background of private research, I have no prior experience with the academic publication process. I'm learning about:
- How to choose appropriate venues for my work
- The peer review process and how to respond to feedback
- Academic standards for reproducibility and open science
- The timeline and expectations for conference submissions

## Working with Faculty and Building Academic Connections

One of my primary goals in the MIDS program is to build relationships with faculty members who can guide my research and potentially collaborate on projects. I'm actively seeking opportunities to work with professors whose research aligns with my interests in multimodal AI and healthcare applications.

## Looking Forward to PhD Applications

My ultimate goal is to pursue a PhD in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, or Computer Science. The research projects I'm starting now are my first steps toward building the academic portfolio necessary for competitive PhD applications. I'm committed to learning as much as possible about the academic research process and contributing meaningfully to the scientific community.

## A Learning Journey

This transition represents a significant learning curve. I'm approaching it with humility and determination, knowing that I have much to learn about academic research while building on the practical experience I've gained in industry. The journey from private research to academic publication is challenging, but I'm excited about the possibilities it presents.

*This blog will continue to document my learning journey as I navigate the transition from industry research to academic scholarship. The path ahead is uncertain, but I'm committed to learning and growing as a researcher.*
