## Research Overview

This project involved leading a research team at DASION to develop a multimodal clinical AI system for depression detection using voice analysis. The work was conducted as private research at DASION with NSF Phase I and II funding support and collaboration with Professor Weiqing Gu from Harvey Mudd College.

## Research Problem and Clinical Significance

Depression affects millions worldwide, yet current diagnostic methods rely heavily on subjective self-reporting and clinical interviews. This research aimed to develop an objective, voice-based biomarker system for depression detection that could complement traditional diagnostic approaches.

## Technical Approach

- **Audio Feature Extraction**: Developed comprehensive acoustic feature extraction pipeline analyzing fundamental frequency, voice quality, pause patterns, and spectral characteristics
- **Neural Network Architecture**: Implemented multimodal fusion techniques combining acoustic features with linguistic content analysis
- **Clinical Validation**: Designed rigorous clinical validation studies with proper statistical analysis and cross-validation protocols

## Research Results

- Achieved **85% classification accuracy** on clinical depression detection
- Developed real-time inference capabilities with sub-second response times
- Created interpretable AI system providing transparent decision-making for clinical deployment

## Research Collaboration and Funding

- **NSF Phase I and II funding** supporting the research initiative
- **Research collaboration with Professor Weiqing Gu** (Harvey Mudd College)
- **Project Lead** - led research team and technical implementation
- **Private Research at DASION** - proprietary healthcare AI research

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

- Addressed real-time processing requirements for clinical applications
- Developed robust feature extraction for diverse voice characteristics
- Implemented interpretable AI frameworks suitable for healthcare deployment

## Future Research Directions

- Expanding to additional mental health conditions
- Integrating with electronic health records
- Developing mobile-based assessment tools
